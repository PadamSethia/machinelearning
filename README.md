# Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Python
This repository contains the basic machine learning algorithms implemented in python from scratch  , but as I progress I'll also put
up the implementations using the SciKit Library .

All the algorithms are coded with reference to **Tom Mitchell** and **Nina Balkan's** [Machine Learning Class 601sp15](cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/courses/601sp15/)
